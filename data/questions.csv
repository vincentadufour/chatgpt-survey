3,Please select your age range,age metric for generative AI use (does a certain age group use generative AI more than others? How does this affect their grades and/or perceptions?),Drop down,
4,What is your major?,sort by major (directly supports RQ1),Typed string/Short Answer,"It may not be preferrable to use a dropdown because of all the different majors available at all three universities. I can clean up inconsistencies later, but important to make sure all majors are represented."
5,What is your current GPA?,Academic performance metric (directly supports RQ2),Typed numerical,Self-reporting will limit accuracy of study
