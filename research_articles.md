      - >"... Schwarz, Kn√§uper, et al. (1991) presented the success-in-life question with an 11-point rating scale that ranged either from 0 *(not at all successful)* to 10 *(extremely successful)*, or from -5 *(not at all successful)* to 5 *(extremely successful)*. The results showed a dramatic impact of the numeric values presented to respondents. Whereas 34% of the respondents endorsed a value between -5 and 0 on the -5 to 5 scale, only 13% endorsed one of the formally equivalent values between 0 and 5 on the 0-10 scale.
