   - Keep pragmatic meaning of a question in mind when asking something
   - Use the four maxims to encourage cooperativeness from the speakers
     - *Maxim of Relation*: Encourage the speaker to make their contribution relevant to the aims of the ongoing conversation.
      - *Maxim of Quantity*: Encourage the speaker to make contributions informative, but not more informative than is required.
      - *Maxim of Manner*: Encourage the speaker to make clear, not wordy, contributions.
      - *Maxim of Quality*: Encourage the speaker not to make false contributions/
   - Numeric scales used has an effect on survey responses: 
   
      - >"... Schwarz, Knäuper, et al. (1991) presented the success-in-life question with an 11-point rating scale that ranged either from 0 *(not at all successful)* to 10 *(extremely successful)*, or from -5 *(not at all successful)* to 5 *(extremely successful)*. The results showed a dramatic impact of the numeric values presented to respondents. Whereas 34% of the respondents endorsed a value between -5 and 0 on the -5 to 5 scale, only 13% endorsed one of the formally equivalent values between 0 and 5 on the 0-10 scale.

**Annotation:**
- **Summary:**
   - The study examines students' use and perceptions of ChatGPT in Swedish universities, finding broad awareness but mixed attitudes. Females and students in humanities and medicine were more skeptical, while males and engineering students showed greater optimism. Results suggest the need for tailored AI solutions in education.

- **Evaluation:**
   - The research is credible; it has a large sample and uses statistical analysis. It effectively highlights differences across demographic groups and majors in Swedish universities.
 
- **Reflection:**
   - The methods used in this study will help shape the way I approach my research on generative AI tool use across demographics and disciplines.

**Annotation:**
- **Summary:**
   - The article investigates university students' awareness, usage, and confidence with generative AI (GenAI) tools, including ChatGPT, at an Australian university. Findings show varied familiarity across disciplines, with frequent use reported in some fields while others had minimal exposure. Confidence in ethical use was mixed, highlighting a need for improved AI literacy and targeted training.

- **Evaluation:**
   - The study seems to be credible, sporting a large sample across Australian universities. The article mentions its own shortcomings with the techniques used in gathering data on generative AI use.
 
- **Reflection:**
   - This study shows vulnerability when mentioning practitioner's notes and what they'd improve upon if they were to repeat this study. I believe these will be crucial to learn from and apply to my own research.

**Annotation:**
- **Summary:**
   - The study examines U.S. student's perception and sentiment towards ChatGPT. They investigate five main student concerns about using ChatGPT: ethical implications, skepticism towards AI, quality of ChatGPT’s output, potential loss of learning and job opportunities, and accessibility.

- **Evaluation:**
   - This research uses a comprehensive survey to capture diverse student perspectives, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI adoption.
 
- **Reflection:**
   - Since this study uses a survey, it'll be helpful in creating my own survey questions around generative AI use. I can examine the questions they used compared to the results they gathered and to influence what questions I ask and how they are asked.

**Annotation:**
- **Summary:**
   - The study examines undergraduate and postgraduate student's across disciplines in Hong Kong and their perceptions and experiences with generative AI. The study finds a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning.

- **Evaluation:**
   - The study effectively captures student perspectives, using survey data to highlight common themes regarding AI’s role in education.
 
- **Reflection:**
   - Looking at survey-based studies will inevitably help me in my own research, but this study specifically explores generative AI use in education not only examining ChatGPT, but additionally including other forms of generative AI, like text-to-image and text-to-audio.

**Annotation:**
- **Summary:**
   - This meta-analysis examines the impact of generative AI on college students' academic achievement. The findings suggest that while AI tools can enhance learning outcomes in certain subjects, the effects are varied, with factors such as discipline, AI tool type, and implementation context playing significant roles.

- **Evaluation:**
   - The meta-analysis is comprehensive, covering multiple studies to provide a broad overview of AI's impact on education. The analysis uses rigorous statistical methods to come to its conclusions.
 
- **Reflection:**
   - This anlysis will help with interpreting the data I gather in my study. I may be able to use the requirements they upheld when looking for applicable studies to shape how I design my own study.

**Annotation:**
- **Summary:**
   - Abbas, Jam, and Khan examine ChatGPT use among students, specifically examining effects of ChatGPT usage on students’ levels of procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance.

- **Evaluation:**
   - The study seems credible, and uses multiple waves with an increasing number of students to find its results.
 
- **Reflection:**
   - I particularly appreciate this student's approach to determining whether generative AI use is helping or hurting student's academic performances and learning outcomes. Their approach considering burnout and procastination will be a helpful factor when creating my study.
