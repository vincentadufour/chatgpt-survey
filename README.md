## Personal Summary
During my Summer 2024 semester, I took 4 non-CS classes at MSU Denver (Biology and Chemistry). These were the first non-CS classes I took since resuming my degree and since ChatGPT gained popularity. Through talking with my classmates, I learned a majority of them seemed to routinely use ChatGPT for almost every assignment acrosses all classes. I became curious as to how much students across different majors/years in their degrees use generative AI tools like ChatGPT.

## Goal of Survey/Study
1. **To measure how much students use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for their schoolwork**
   - MSU Denver? CU Denver? UCD?
2. **To measure use rates across majors**
   - Do some majors use ChatGPT more than others? How does the median compare to CS majors?
3. **To measure use rates across years**
   - Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior
4. **To measure how much students use ChatGPT for schoolwork vs. personal reasons**
   - To filter out irrelevant use
5. **To measure levels of trust/confidence in ChatGPT**
   - Do students use ChatGPT to double-check answers, or to source answers?
6. **To measure use rates across age ranges**
   - MSU Denver has a uniquely varied age demographic which will mean seniors may have a wide age spread. Adding an age metric can help measure if there's a difference in use for returning students vs. students on a regular college track
7. **To measure how much/if ChatGPT has helped/hindered their learning**
8. **To measure how much/if ChatGPT has helped/hindered their grades**
   - Separating learning from grades to see if students notice higher learning/higher grades or lower learning/higher grades, etc

   - Keep pragmatic meaning of a question in mind when asking something
   - Use the four maxims to encourage cooperativeness from the speakers
     - *Maxim of Relation*: Encourage the speaker to make their contribution relevant to the aims of the ongoing conversation.
      - *Maxim of Quantity*: Encourage the speaker to make contributions informative, but not more informative than is required.
      - *Maxim of Manner*: Encourage the speaker to make clear, not wordy, contributions.
      - *Maxim of Quality*: Encourage the speaker not to make false contributions/
