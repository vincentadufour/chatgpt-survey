## Personal Summary
During my Summer 2024 semester, I took 4 non-CS classes at MSU Denver (Biology and Chemistry). These were the first non-CS classes I took since resuming my degree and since ChatGPT gained popularity. Through talking with my classmates, I learned a majority of them seemed to routinely use ChatGPT for almost every assignment acrosses all classes. I became curious as to how much students across different majors/years in their degrees use generative AI tools like ChatGPT.

## Roadmap
1. **Find three-four studies researching similar questions about generative AI use with students**
   - Use these studies to gather survey question techniques and find how effective their methods were
   - Create a launching pad to build hypothesis and questions off of later
2. **Find studies looking into how to design survey questions and the impact of survey wording and techniques**
   - This will help ensure survey questions are efficient and are as unbiased as possible
3. **Create a hypothesis surrounding students and generative AI use**
   - This hypothesis will drive what the survey's questions are and serve as a sounding board to assure each question addresses the hypothesis
4. **Create questions**
   - Have questions be peer-reviewed to eliminate overseen inconsistencies
5. **Create incentive for taking survey**
   - This could be done with funds from undergrad research grant, or another option
   - Will help incentivize students to take survey and increase dataset
6. **Find survey system**
   - Google Forms, Survey Monkey, or otherwise, need to find a survey software that'll meet my needs
7. **Launch survey on campus**
   - Flyer with a QR code
      - Will require permission to put up in several buildings across campus
   - Email from department managers (Corrie Velazquez equivalents) to their student bodies?
   - Will need to be careful to be distributing the survey equally across campus to reduce location bias
8. **Data cleaning**
9. **Data analysis & visualizations**
   - Use qualitative data analysis & visualizations to support hypothesis
10. **Create research paper**
   - Complete with an abstract, methodology, results, and conclusion
11. **Present at Undergraduate Research Conference?**
   - Likely will depend on timing and results

## Study Hypotheses

- **H1:** Computer Science students have a disproportionate increase in academic performance when using generative AI for academic work than other majors.
- **H2:** Use of generative AI for academic work affects student's academic performance differently based on their major and coursework.

## Research Questions

- **RQ1:** To what extent do students in different majors use generative AI for academic work?
- **RQ2:** How does high use of generative AI in academic settings correlate with academic performance?
- **RQ3:** In what ways do students in different majors perceive benefits from generative AI use in academic work?
