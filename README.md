> Survey question brainstorming for a project at MSU Denver

## Goal of Survey/Study
1. To measure how much students (MSU Denver? CU Denver? UCD?) use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for their schoolwork
2. To measure the different use rates across majors
3. To measure the different use rates across years (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior)
4. To measure how much students use ChatGPT for schoolwork vs. personal reasons
