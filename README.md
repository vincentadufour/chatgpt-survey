## Personal Summary
During my Summer 2024 semester, I took 4 non-CS classes at MSU Denver (Biology and Chemistry). These were the first non-CS classes I took since resuming my degree and since ChatGPT gained popularity. Through talking with my classmates, I learned a majority of them seemed to routinely use ChatGPT for almost every assignment acrosses all classes. I became curious as to how much students across different majors/years in their degrees use generative AI tools like ChatGPT.

## Goal of Survey/Study
1. **To measure how much students use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for their schoolwork** (MSU Denver? CU Denver? UCD?)
2. **To measure use rates across majors** (Do some majors use ChatGPT more than others? How does the median compare to CS majors?)
4. **To measure use rates across years** (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior)
5. **To measure how much students use ChatGPT for schoolwork vs. personal reasons** (to filter out unwanted use levels)
6. **To measure levels of trust/confidence in ChatGPT** (Do students use ChatGPT to double-check answers, or to source answers?)
7. **To measure use rates across age ranges** (MSU Denver has a uniquely varied age demographic which will mean seniors may have a wide age spread. Adding an age metric can help measure if there's a difference in use for returning students vs. students on a regular college track)
